# E-commerce-Website
This project was constructed using ASP.NET, MVC 5, T-SQL, Entity Framework, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, C#, SendGrid API (Email), BrainTree API (Credit Card Processing), and Twilio (SMS Messaging). 

The premise of this project was to quickly build a fully functional E-Commerce store that sells Raspberry Pi's and Raspberry Pi accessories. My insperation 
for this store comes from playing around with Raspberry Pi computers the past couple years. In addition to this I think the Raspberry Pi is an 
awesome foundation that helps promote the study of basic computer science for children in schools.

Functionality of the Raspberry Pi Store includes:
- Registering and signing into an account with the Raspberry Pi Store
    - User maintains ability to change password
- Exploring the products offered by category
- View individual products and add them to shopping cart
    - A cookie is created and tracks what is in the users shopping cart
- Review your shopping cart
    - Update the Quantity of individual Products
    - Remove products entirely from shopping cart
    - See total prices for products and entire shopping cart
- Checkout and have credit card processed
- Email verification
    - When you create an account with Raspberry Pi Store
    - When you place an order with Raspberry Pi Store
        - Order receipt is included
- SMS notification when an order has been processed
- BrainTree Sandbox account can see transactions that are successful
